        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Paarth Agrawal, a current freshman student attending Emerald High School.  The classes I am taking this year include Computer Science Essentials, taught by Mr. Baez, English 1, Spanish 2, Freshman PE, Advanced Algebra 2, Biology, and Health.  Out of school, I am studying Precalculus at both Brigham Young University, and AoPS.
        Also, </p>
        <p>I am a freshman of Emerald High School</p>
        <p>I hope to go to UC Berkeley for a bachelors degree in economics.  After that, I am either going to get an MBA (business degree) or a law degree.  I love to read, and hope to write my own book someday</p>

        <p>I work to learn something new everyday.  I enjoy mathematics and hope to integrate it into my learning so that my skill has no limits!</p>

        <p>I also love telling jokes!  Here's one: What job profession always has the most sensitive people?  Computer Scientists, because they hate it if someone bugs them :D (insert roaring laughter).</p>
    
        <p>In order to achieve my goals in life I will need to work hard and study.  I will need to get great grades in all of my classes and also learn from each of them.</p>
    
        <p>I haven't accomplished much in high school.  I'm only 12% or so done with it, after all!  However, I am advancing in Boy Scouts, aiming to become an Eagle Scout by the end of the year.  I also made it all the to the quarterfinals of the TOC Digital Debate Series 1 Debate Tournament, the same one Alex has in his portfolio.</p>

        <p>I hope you enjoyed reading this!  If you made it to the end, I would strongly appreciate getting an A on this assignment!  Please?</p>
