        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Paarth Agrawal, a current freshman student attending Emerald High School.  The classes I am taking this year include Computer Science Essentials, taught by Mr. Baez, English 1, Spanish 2, Freshman PE, Advanced Algebra 2, Biology, and Health.  Out of school, I am studying Precalculus at both Brigham Young University, and AoPS.
        Also, I have a lot of previous engineering experience, with an advanced understanding of the Python language.  I have coded many different applications and games in Python, such as Hangman, Blackjack, Connect4, and more.  In my CSE class, I have programmed even more applications, like an experimental Pokemon Game with my classmates,
        an algorithm to take in orders for certain meals and return a final cost, and an algorithm to consistently win Rock-Paper-Scissor games. In the future, I hope to get further experience with Computer Science, specifically through expanding my math knowledge and learning how to code machine learning to create functional AI.  I hope to use this to
        get an internship at a software engineering company, as well as to study Computer Science in college as one of my biggest focuses.  I am extremely excited to continue with my education and learn even more about the world around me and how to improve it!</p>
        <p>I am a freshman of Emerald High School</p>
        <p>I hope to go to UC Berkeley for a bachelors degree in economics.  After that, I am either going to get an MBA (business degree) or a law degree.  I love to read, and hope to write my own book someday</p>
